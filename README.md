# Advent-of-Code-2020
Welcome to 2020 Advent of Code! well my attempts at working through it. I like the thought of accountability so plan on posting my completed code here. 

**Below is a list of the skills i used and learned while compleating Advent of code:**
  - lists
  - comparason operators,
  - boolean values,
  - flow control statements,
  - for loops, 
  - inputing data from a .txt file,
  - indexes,
  - functions,
  - regular expressions,
 -------

### DAY 1:
Before you go on holiday the elves want you to finish your expense reports.

They want you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together. Part 2 requires you to find three entries that sum to 2020 and multiply them together. 
  
### DAY 2:
You help the toboggan rental place sort out their password system. 

The code goes through the Password database and checking if the passwords are valid using the policy listed by each password  In part 2 each policy is described a different way and you must go through and validate using a different method.

### DAY 3: 
You are off tobogganing! but the route to the airport is full of trees and the toboggan dosent have the best stearing.

The code plots a route for the tobogga using a map and steering of the toboggan (3 right, 1 down), the code wull see how many trees you will hit. Part 2 requires you to try a few different steering choices.

### DAY 4: 
At the airport you realise you only have your North Pole Credentials instead of your passport. 

The code validates each person scanning their passport, checking if the passport data has all of the required fields (ignoring Country ID so as to allow your North Pole Credentials to work also). Part 2 requires you to actually validate the data in the fields and chack they match the requirements. 

### DAY 5:
You have boarded the plane but lost your boarding pass and dont know which seat is yours. 

The code goes through all other boarding passes on the plane, figures out which seat the data on the boarding pass relates to as it uses binary space partitioning to seat people. it then finds the seat ID for each seat and finds the highest seat ID number. Part 2 goes through the entire seat ID list and figures out which seat is missing, this is your seat. 

### DAY 6:
You land and must go through customs and fill in a questionaire. all it needs to know is which questions you answer yes to. and everyone on the plane needs help. 

The code goes through and condenses everyones questionaire answers and finds out how many yes's there are in each group of people. it then sums the answer for the entire plane. Part two you realise you need to know each time everyone in the group answered yes to the same question.
