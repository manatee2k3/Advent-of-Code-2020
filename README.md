# Advent-of-Code-2020
A collection of my code as I work through The Advent of Code

Welcome to 2020 Advent of Code! well my attempts at working through it. I like the thought of accountability so plan on posting my completed code here. 


# DAY 1:
You're off to a tropical island this year, saving christmas has been tough work and you deserve a rest. however the elves need you to complete your expense reports before you head out. They want you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together. Part 2 requires you to find three entries that sum to 2020 and multiply them together. 
  
**This code required the use of lists, comparason operators, boolean values, flow control statements, for loops and inputing data from a .txt file.**

# DAY 2:
Your flight to the tropical island leaves from a coastal town, to get there you hire a toboggan. When you get to the toboggan rental place you find they are having a nightmare with their password system. To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. In Part 2 Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on.

**This code required the use of regular expressions, lists, indexes, comparason operators, boolean values, flow control statements, for loops and inputing data from a .txt file**

# DAY 3: 
You are off tobogganing! but the route to the airport is full of trees and the toboggan dosent have the best stearing. Using a map you must plot your route using the steering of the toboggan (3 right, 1 down), and see how many trees you will hit. Part 2 requires you to use a few different steering choices.

 **This code required the use of; functions, lists, indexes, comparason operators, boolean values, flow control statements, for loops and inputing data from a .txt file**
