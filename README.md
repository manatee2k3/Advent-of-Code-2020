# Advent-of-Code-2020
A collection of my code as I work through The Advent of Code

Welcome to 2020 Advent of Code! well my attempts at working through it. I like the thought of accountability so plan on posting my completed code here. 


DAY 1:
You're off to a tropical island this year, saving christmas has been tough work and you deserve a rest. however the elves need you to complete your expense reports before you head out. They want you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together. Part 2 requires you to find three entries that sum to 2020 and multiply them together. 
  
This code required the use of lists, comparason operators, boolean values, flow control statements, for loops and inputing data from a .txt file.

DAY 2:
Your flight to the tropical island leaves from a coastal town, to get there you hire a toboggan. When you get to the toboggan rental place you find they are having a nightmare with their password system. To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times. In Part 2 Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on. (Be careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!) Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement.

This code required the use of regular expressions, lists, indexes, comparason operators, boolean values, flow control statements, for loops and inputing data from a .txt file
