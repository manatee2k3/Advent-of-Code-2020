# The tobogan store is having trouble with their password system and need your help
# each line gives the password policy and then the password
# the policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear
# eg. 1-3 a : abcde
#     the password must contain a at least 1 and at most 3 times
#     abcde is valid as a is there once
